### To do:

## Get raw hall value (not ninetieth distance mm value) because when calculate distances looks at asymptotic value from raw hall. Truncate raw hall values on percentilelim function. from previous chunk and use as 
#Get max of percentilRange and use as raw hall value. Then plug in as argument in 
# Do this with aVal and bVal

##Callibration stuff???

Figure out why the combogape file has a bunch of extraneous columns added onto 
the front of the file. They may be rownumbers getting saved as new columns

### calculate individual % open/closed. Then take average of all oysters in each treatment/site/by month but average has to be weighted bc some oysters only collect for 1 day vs others for 3 months. Then somehow do variance with weighted averages.

# Function cRegressEstimate
# Currently this represents the best data showing how the relationship between
# magnet signal and distance is repeatable and consistent among different
# magnets (all from the same batch/part number). As such, a non-linear curve
# can be fit to the various calibration runs to generate a set of 
# coefficients a,b,c for an asymptotic curve. Then the values from a field 
# mussel can be analyzed to determine the asymptotic maximum count value
# (widest opening) and minimum count value (fully closed), which give us the
# parameters for coefficients a and b in the curve fit. Because the curvature
# coefficient 'c' of the curves is very linear with respect to the coefficient
# 'b' (range of readings), we can plug in the max vs. min range for a particular
# mussel and use that to predict the appropriate curve coefficient 'c' to use
# for that mussel.

# Comments after playing with this: The simple algorithm does the thing I 
# expect it to do, adjusting the rising Hall values down to a flat baseline. 
# However, what you also see is that the maximum (presumed 100% opening) values
# start to shrink through time after the downward correction. This happens 
# because the actual range of Hall values is getting smaller as the animal 
# grows and the baseline closed value shifts upwards. This is a result of the
# curvelinear response of the hall effect sensor and the fact that when you
# start with the magnet further from the Hall sensor in the closed position,
# any opening of the shell results in a comparatively smaller change in the
# Hall value, because you're starting in a less-sensitive portion of the Hall
# sensor's range. Therefore it may be counterproductive to adjust these Hall
# signals down to have a flat baseline, because it will later result in a
# calculation of a smaller % opening if the total range is shrinking through 
# time. Instead we want to keep the shifting baseline information intact,
# and use it alongside sensor calibration data that come from different starting
# values to adjust the estimated shell opening values into percentages.
